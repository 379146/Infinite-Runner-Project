# Infinite-Runner-Project

High level concept: You play as a character who has just pulled off a heist and must run away with their ill-gotten cash.
To do so you must travel in a straight line jumping, sliding and dodging left and right to avoid obstacles, while picking up more bundles of cash or jewels along the way.
The player character will always move at a constant but increasing speed, it is the players only duty to control the jumping and sliding and such.
As the player runs into obstacles they will be stopped momentarily and will thus be pushed back towards the camera as the camera will not stop moving.
Once the player gets too close to the camera and ultimately falls behind the game will end. 

## Controls:
